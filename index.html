				  Hey there!<br>
          I am Alina,<br>
	Product Design Leader
				</h1>
				
				<section id="who_am_i">
					<p>Currently, I lead product design at SaferMe where we make Health & Safety easy and provide the best contact tracing solution in the market for businesses.</p>
					<p>Before that, I worked in EDU space, social media, and cyber-security. Three different start-ups, all at different stages of growth. I know what success and failure looks like.</p>
					<p>I started my journey as a front-end developer but life turned me to design experiences instead.</p>
					<p>I love uncovering truths; it's like watching a Columbo or Moonlighting episode. It's detective work that always pays off.</p>

				  On Leadership
				</h1>
				
				<div class="column lead-points">
					<span class="geo-icon"></span>
					<h3>Enable and Empower</h3>
					<p>Great leaders are great not because they are irreplaceable. They enable each member of their team to be the best version of themselves. They teach them all the skills they have. They pass all the wisdom there is to pass. A great leader can walk away, and the team will thrive.</p>
					<p>As Julie Zhuo, ex-VP of design at Facebook said: <em>"What matters more is how much of a multiplier effect she [manager] has on her team."</em></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="column lead-points">
					<span class="geo-icon v2"></span>
					<h3>Healthy Disagreements</h3>
					<p>I believe that this is the most important quality you, as a manager, can establish with your team. It takes a while to get here but as a manager, you need to work on this EVERY SINGLE DAY. Letting your team members disagree while making them feel secure is the most empowering experience you can give to anyone. Including yourself.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="column lead-points">
					<span class="geo-icon v3"></span>
					<h3>Pro-active Honesty</h3>
					<p>As designers, we’re taught that critical feedback is everything. This is how you make good products. However, this is also how you make excellent manager-employee relationships. Being honest with each other early and often builds the strongest foundation of relationships. And it goes both ways. As a manager, you need to provide critical feedback to your employees but also you need to teach THEM that they need to do the same for you.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="column lead-points">
					<span class="geo-icon v4"></span>
					<h3>Genuine listening</h3>
					<p>We spend hours every day listening. But how often do we ACTIVELY listen and try to understand? As simple as it sounds, this is not a skill that comes easily. On top of it, due to inherent biases, we may find we are inclined to disregard what others are saying based on their skill level or other dislikes. In the end, we end up dismissing a lot of crucial information, great ideas, or simple good-hearted conversations. Active genuine listening is a skill worth practicing.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="column lead-points">
					<span class="geo-icon"></span>
					<h3>Emphasize strengths</h3>
					<p>This seems pretty straight forward. But what happens when you get into a disagreement with someone on your team, discover an easily avoided mistake, or see things go completely sideways? And how often do you sit and internalize with rage: ”How could they!?”, “This is unacceptable!”, or “Did I make a mistake hiring them!”? This is when you give yourself some time to rage (about an hour), then take a deep breath, and remember all the great things they have done and are capable of. “Remember that time when they went above and beyond?”</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="column lead-points">
					<span class="geo-icon v2"></span>
					<h3>Protect Your Team</h3>
					<p>Politics is unavoidable. Politics emerges in the best of companies, and definitely in the not so best. Protecting your team is crucial so they can focus on their jobs, and not get bogged down by worries and gossip. You should stand at the forefront, accepting blame, and taking responsibility when things go wrong.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="column lead-points">
					<span class="geo-icon v3"></span>
					<h3>We are not Robots</h3>
					<p>At least, not yet.. We have feelings, bad days and good days. As a manager, we need to recognize all of these. Don’t let your people fall further when you can lend them a hand, allow them to take a breath, and guide them forward.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="column lead-points">
					<span class="geo-icon v4"></span>
					<h3>Invest in future generation</h3>
					<p>I see many companies (especially start-ups) bringing in fresh graduates, motivated by cheap labor. New workforce needs mentors, a nurturing environment, structure, and processes. Otherwise, this is a recipe for burnout. Your employees leave, jaded and questioning their career choices. We need to give back, inspire, mentor, and set the best examples we can.</p>
