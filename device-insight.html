					<p>Device insight was the first data visualization feature that was introduced at Duo Security in early 2016. The goal of this feature was to help our customers (IT administrators) to understand the health state of his devices at a glance. We let this feature live and breath for 1.5 years and then we returned to make it better.</p>

					Why did we do it in the first place?

					<blockquote cite="">75% of breaches happen because compromised user devices.</blockquote>
					<p>Every year, Verizon has been releasing a security report. And every year we have been told over and over again that most of the breaches happen because of compromised devices or compromised credentials. What are we calling here a "compromised device"? The devices that is running out of date software such as operating system, browser, or plugin. These devices are a threat to a security of a company. So we asked ourselves here at Duo, how can we help?</p>
					<p>Because Duo provides two-factor authentication within a browser, we were able to determine which os, browser, or plugin you are using. This exact information is crucial to understanding if a device is safe to enter a work application.</p>
